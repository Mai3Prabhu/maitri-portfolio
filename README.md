Maitri Prabhu: Developer & Creative Architect üë©‚Äçüíªüé®
Live Demo: [Link to your live Render site here]

A personalized, full-stack portfolio built with Flask and Jinja2, designed to merge technical proficiency in backend development with expressive creative pursuits (Dance, Poetry, and Painting).

üöÄ Project Overview
This repository hosts the source code for my professional portfolio website. It serves as a comprehensive showcase of my skills in Full-Stack Development, Data Structures, and Algorithm Design, balanced by a deep dive into my personal journey through the Creative Corner.

The core philosophy of the design is to establish a strong personal brand: Logic by Day, Rhythm by Night.

Key Technical Stack
Category

Technology

Purpose

Backend

Python 3.11, Flask

Lightweight web framework for routing and template rendering.

Styling

Tailwind CSS

Utility-first framework used for rapid, fully responsive UI development.

Templating

Jinja2

Used to dynamically render pages, manage data loops (e.g., Projects, Poetry), and handle data transfer to JavaScript.

Deployment

Gunicorn, Render

Gunicorn serves the application in production; Render provides continuous deployment (CD).

‚ú® Featured Sections & Custom Design
1. The Projects Section
The Projects page breaks away from standard card layouts, featuring unique container shapes for key projects like Insightify and Spacebot.

Insightify Showcase: Features an integrated, smooth image swiper to display multiple project screenshots without leaving the card.

Chic CTA: The "Explore My Full GitHub" button includes a custom 3D pop-up/see-saw hover animation using CSS Transforms.

2. The Creative Corner (A Unique Personal Brand)
This section is designed to stand out, proving versatility beyond engineering:

Custom Circular Carousel: The hub page uses a unique, 3-card circular slider to visually present Dance/Music, Poetry, and Painting, encouraging interactive discovery.

High-Fidelity Galleries:

Poetry: Displays full poems in a clean, vertical card structure with a gentle zoom-on-hover effect.

Paintings: Uses a stable, responsive 3x2 grid layout where every image triggers a click-to-zoom modal for high-resolution viewing.

3. Theme & Aesthetics
Dual Mode: Supports both Light Mode (soft white/lilac) and Dark Mode (deep gray/bright lemon yellow) with a custom toggle button.

Professional Framing: The homepage features the developer's headshot perfectly framed using advanced object-position CSS to ensure precise framing within the circular container.
